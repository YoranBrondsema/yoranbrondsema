Over the past few months, a few readers have emailed me to question my allocation to bonds in my portfolio. This is not a surprise, given their recent poor performance. Also, it doesn't look like central banks are going to increase the interest rates any time soon, meaning that this it's expected that this trend will continue for a couple of years. I'm on uncomfortable territory here because I just made a macro-economic prediction, which is an intellectually arrogant thing to do. But even if interest rates do rise tomorrow, it's not going to be a very fast process.

The emails from readers made me reflect back on the question of why I have bonds in my portfolio in the first place. The easy answer is because knowledgeable people who studied finance extensively say so. But why do they recommend to include government bonds in your portfolio? I think there are two reasons:
1. As a stabilizer
2. As a diversifier

### As a stabilizer
Stocks can go wild, both up and down. And knowledgeable people know about the psychological of investors. Allocating some bonds to your portfolio reduces the depth and length of drawdowns when facing a downturn. For some people, this means the difference between selling the portfolio at the worst possible moment, or staying the course.

For instance, historical data shows that a 100% equities portfolio dropped by over 50% in 2008, and took many years to recover. A portfolio consisting of 50% bonds and 50% equities dropped by less than 20% and recovered a lot faster.

The crucial point though is that this is completely up to the investor. Some would have been fine in 2008 with a 100% equities portfolio and would have stayed the course.

When I first started investing, I didn't know what kind of investor I was. I had yet to find out about my investment psychology. And coming out of the corona-crisis, I am now fairly confident that I have a strong stomach. Although it wasn't as severe as the 2008 financial crisis, the sudden drop early 2020 was bad enough that a few of my friends sold their investments because "this time it's different".

On my side though, I didn't bat an eye. All throughout, I remained confident that the fundamentals of the world economy hadn't changed in a way that made future growth impossible. Some industries have shrunk and some companies have gone bust. Others have flourished and new entrants that have seized the opportunity have come in. But that is the natural course of things in an ever-changing world with millions of feedback loops left and right. And this is also not an issue for the person who holds index funds. By nature, dying companies leave the index at some point and make room for better companies to join.

This experience made me feel that I'm capable of going through a severe downturn without getting scared and make a stupid decision. Given this knowledge about myself, I think that I can give up on bonds and go for a 100% equities portfolio. At least until a shrinking time horizon will make it necessary to re-allocate a portion to bonds and go for a 100% equities portfolio. At least until a shrinking time horizon will make it necessary to re-allocate a portion to bonds.
