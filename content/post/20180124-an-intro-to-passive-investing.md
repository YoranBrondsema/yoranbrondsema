For the past few months I've been interested in passive investing. I [read
books](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/120281.Books_about_investing), did
research online and have been investing a portion of my savings.

Many of the things I read are targeted to investors living in the US.
Fortunately, a lot of the knowledge carries over to any other country. Still,
while investing myself, I encountered Belgium-specific things that I had to
figure out. Therefore, if you're living in Belgium and are getting into passive
investing, this series of posts could be useful to you.

### Why passive investing?
These days, the interest offered on your savings account is very low. For
instance, my bank BNP Paribas Fortis offers an interest rate of 0.11% on my
savings account. At the time of writing, the inflation rate of the Eurozone is
at 1.4%. This means that I am losing buying power year-on-year if I keep all my
money on the savings account.

In those conditions, it makes sense to have your money somewhere that gives you
a return at least as high as the inflation rate (in that case you don't win
buying power but also don't lose any). Passive investing means investing in
*low-risk* securities that yield good returns when invested for the *long-term*
and that don't require a lot of trading (as opposed to *active* investing where
you trade daily or multiple times per day).

### Spread the risks
The S&P 500, i.e. the 500 biggest American companies, has had an average yearly
return of 10% since its inception in 1928. As you can see on [this
table](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/histretSP.html),
it has hit returns as high as 52% (in 1954) and lows as low as -43.84% (in
1931). However, if you take a long-enough time period such as 30 years, the
average return rate will be around 10%. The ever-increasing productivity due to
technology and economical progress is at the root of this positive return.

That is a lot higher than the 0.11% interest rate! The key to passive investing
is that you invest in a collection of stocks rather than an individual stock.
This greatly lowers the risk as it spreads your bets across an entire industry
(e.g. technology), geographical region (e.g. emerging markets) or even the
entire world. By investing in a set of diverse high-risk stocks, you lower the
risk of the entire portfolio. This is the basis of [Modern portfolio
theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory#Diversification). 

### Index funds and ETFs
You'll find many books and resources talk about index funds, such as those
offered by Vanguard. Unfortunately, these are not available to us in Europe but
we have access to something similar called an ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund). There
are differences between ETFs and index funds but the main point is that both
follow a collection of stocks instead of an individual stock.

### How do I start investing in Belgium?
In the next blog post I will dive deeper into how to start with passive
investing if you live in Belgium.
