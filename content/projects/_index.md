Here is a selection of the projects that I am working on or have worked on in
the past.

## [Curvo](https://curvo.eu)
Our latest project that I introduced [in a post](https://www.yoranbrondsema.com/post/introducing-enzo-a-better-way-of-saving-money/).
Investing is hard yet I believe it's crucial for our generation to be
well-prepared for the future. Curvo aims to make passive investing easy and
accessible to European millennials.

## [Sutori](https://www.sutori.com)
I'm also the CTO of Sutori. It's the app that I've spent the most time working
on. It's also the biggest piece of software that I've built. It's currently
used by over 1.4 million teachers and students across the world, which is
something we're all proud of!

## [Backtest](https://backtest.curvo.eu)
The back-testing tool for European index investors. Many of the articles on
this blog are analyses of my portfolio. For that, I built my own custom
back-testing software. Over time, it evolved into something pretty valuable so
I released it for others to use.

## [What If I Lose My 2FA](https://www.whatifilosemy2fa.com)
This project was born out of frustration with losing access to my 2FA-secured
accounts after I had to reinstall my phone. It gives the exact information that
you need to keep somewhere safe in case you lose your 2FA device. This way you
don't have to waste time visiting your bank and having a notary sign papers,
like I did.

## [Music](https://soundcloud.com/yorbro)
In the past, I dabbled around with Ableton and a MIDI controller to make music.
