  I enjoy learning and I think reading books is one of the best ways to deepen
  oneself into a topic. Many wise people have walked the Earth over thousands
  of years and put their thoughts into writing for the next generations to
  discover. It would be a waste not to take in some of that knowledge. For that
  reason, I make an effort to read every day, even if it's only a couple of
  pages. I mostly read non-fiction but I occasionally read works of fiction
  too.

  The list below enumerates all the books that I've read since July 2013. That
  is when I started tracking my reading on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/22085294-yoran?shelf=read">Goodreads</a>. My favorite books are marked <span style="font-weight: bold;">in bold</span>.
