1. Current state
  * IWDA vs XG7S
  * S&P500 vs Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index
2. Historical correlation between bonds and equities
3. Why is there much difference now?


- usually, bonds and stocks move in the same direction.

Why do you need bonds?
- bonds are sometimes negatively correlated with equities. That is an important
  assumption in Markovitz's modern portfolio theory.
- see historical data
  (https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/bulletin/2014/sep/8.html)
- has been negative for very long time, until 2000s. Strongly positive ever since.


The stock-bond yield correlation has been positive for an extended period over
the past 15 years, in contrast to the negative correlation observed throughout
much of the 20th century. An important factor underlying the recent, relatively
long period of positive correlations has been the considerable and lingering
uncertainty created by the global financial crisis, which saw correlations rise
in a continuation of the pattern observed during other recessionary periods over
the past century. The relatively long period of positive correlation is
consistent with an increase in the importance of uncertainty about future
economic activity in driving investor asset allocation decisions. Shifts in US
monetary policy regimes have been associated with reduced stock-bond yield
correlations, although it is difficult to distinguish between the impact of
recent unconventional monetary policies and the economic developments that have
underpinned such policies.
