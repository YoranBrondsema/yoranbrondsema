I am convinced that passive investing (also called index investing) is the best way for most people to grow their wealth and prepare for their financial future. I [started a company](/entrepreneurship) around this idea.

## 2021 - present
In July 2021, I switched my investments over to [Curvo](https://curvo.eu), the
app that I developed together with my co-founder Thomas Ketchell. I'm currently on the [Growth portfolio](https://curvo.eu/portfolios#growth). You can also [explore its past performance](https://curvo.eu/backtest/portfolio/curvo-growth--NoIgwgrgTgbg9gAgOJTgdwC4AsQBpigCSAogAykBCArACxUBsA7DTXqQHQAcAuviCeQoBpAGqkA6gCYaAZjbtJ3JUA).

## 2018 - 2021
I believe in passive investing through index funds as the best way to invest as
an average common investor.

The portfolio is inspired by the recommendations given by Rick Ferri in his
book [All About Asset Allocation](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9316522-all-about-asset-allocation).
Many of the funds available to Americans are not accessible to Europeans like
myself so I had to build an EU-version of the portfolio he suggests.
