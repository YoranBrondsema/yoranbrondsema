I believe in passive investing through index funds as the best way to invest as
an average common investor.

The portfolio is inspired by the recommendations given by Rick Ferri in his book [All About Asset Allocation](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9316522-all-about-asset-allocation).
Many of the funds available to Americans are not accessible to Europeans like
myself so I had to build an EU-version of the portfolio he suggests.
