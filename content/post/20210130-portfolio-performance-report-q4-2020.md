## My investments as of January 1st 2021
### Composition
After the modifications I did earlier in the year (see why I removed the [small-cap fund]({{< ref "post/20200516-simplifying-my-portfolio-pt-1-questioning-the-small-cap-fund.md" >}}) and the [REIT fund]({{< ref "post/20200628-simplifiying-my-portfolio-pt-2-what-about-reits.md" >}})), my portfolio has remained unchanged:

| ETF                                                                                                 | Type        | Allocation 
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|------------
| [Xtrackers Global Government Bond EUR Hedged](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?isin=LU0378818131) | Bonds   | 18%

### Growth of the portfolio
{{< figure src="/images/2020-q4-portfolio-growth.svg" caption="Portfolio performance as of January 1st 2021." >}}

The end of the year was very good. I didn't invest any additional funds but the
value of my portfolio nonetheless grew by 7.6%. I was happy to be invested to
make use of the rising prices!

My portfolio is currently valued at **€42,180**, with total gains of €6,251 or
**18.1%**. Since the start of my investment adventure in the second quarter of
2018, I've seen an compound annual growth rate of 6.9%.

### Performance per asset

Both equities in developed markets and emerging markets recovered well. But the rise of emerging markets has definitely been spectacular.

## What I learned this year: peace of mind is invaluable
This year's corona-crisis was the first crisis that I experienced. On the
various investment communities that I participate in, I saw a fairly high
number of people who panicked, sold and decided to wait until "better times
come". I can't imagine how much additional stress this must have put on them
during the rest of the year. Because that decision meant that they had to
carefully track the markets on a daily basis to make sure that they didn't miss
the rise they're waiting for. Some people most likely got lucky and came back
in at the right time, but I suspect a large number missed the boat and bought
back in either too early or too late.

**Seeing that, the peace of mind that comes with staying the course became very
apparent to me this year.** By leaving my investment pattern unchanged throughout
the year and trust that the markets would recover eventually, I didn't have to
feel any of the stress that comes with needing to time the markets. When times
got better towards the second half of the year, it felt good knowing that I was
still fully invested and that I would reap the complete benefits of the rising
markets.

Of course, it would have been possible that I was wrong about the eventual
recovery of the markets. Maybe this time it was different and the corona-crisis
was really a unique event for the financial markets compared to other events in
the past. Maybe that unlike the 2008 financial crisis, or the second World War
for that matter, the global economy would not have recovered from the pandemic
and that humanity had reached a peak in terms of economic productivity that it
would never reach again.

What would have been the odds? Certainly not zero. But I'd say not very high
either, likely close to zero. So from a rational point of view, I do not think
that it's a reasonable standpoint to sell your investments because you think
the economy as it is has reached a peak and will never recover again. The odds
are so much against you. And if you do think so, with such low odds, you might
as well go all-in and short the entire market.

Of course, all of this is the old "your psychology is the investor's worst
enemy" saying that all investment books talk about. And I think that this year
was a test for many. I'm personally glad and grateful that I didn't succumb to
the temptation and that my rational belief in the foundation of passive
investing ended victorious over my psychology and biases. I'm confident for the
future!
