Although I didn't intent it from the start, my writing on this blog has focused
more and more on investing. I started caring about my financial well-being and
investing in 2017, and have been documenting my investment journey:

* The finance sector is vast, confusing and requires quite a lot of knowledge
  just to get started. The products and solutions offered by the various
  companies in the industry are not as user-friendly as they should be (at least
  not in Europe). Through my writing, **I want to help people to get started
  investing by explaining things in simple terms.**
* There are many books, blogs, forums and other resources available to learn
  about investing. However, most of them are focused on the US. When I got
  started, I found that there was a gap in the information available for
  European investors. This blog therefore **is written specifically for European
  investors**.

## Performance reports
I post the performance reports of [my portfolio](/investment-portfolio) on a
quarterly basis. The regularity gives me the discipline to keep track and get
insights.
