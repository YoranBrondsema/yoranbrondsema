## Composition
The funds in my portfolio haven't changed since [last quarter]({{< ref "post/portfolio-performance-report-q4-2018.md" >}}). Also, there's no need to rebalance yet.

## Growth of portfolio
{{< figure src="/images/2019-q1-portfolio-growth.svg" caption="Portfolio performance as of April 1st 2019." >}}

Over the past 3 months, I invested a total of €1,621 into the portfolio. The
growth has been pretty spectacular: the total return went from a €1,821 loss on
January 1st to a **€1,812 profit today**.

## Performance per asset
{{< figure src="/images/2019-q1-performance-per-asset.svg" caption="Performance per asset as of April 1st 2019." >}}

In the chart above, you can see that pretty much every fund in the portfolio
recovered over the last 3 months.

## Conclusion
Naturally, the strong performance of the markets during since the beginning of
the year have put my in a good mood. However, as we've seen in the last quarter
of 2018, things can change very quickly. The important thing is not to affected
emotionally by the fluctuations and to stay the course!

Let's end with a quote that I heard recently. 

> "Physics has three laws that explain 99% of the phenomena, finance has 99 laws
> that explain only 3%." — [Andrew Lo](https://twitter.com/AndrewWLo)

My interpretation is that in essence, finance is a social science and not a hard
science like physics. The heavy use of mathematics and statistics in the field
can sometimes hide this. However, in the end it's still all about explaning
human behavior!
