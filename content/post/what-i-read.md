I like to read. In fact, I seem to like it more and more as I've been reading
more and more books every year. To maintain a record, I assembled all the books
that I read since July 2013 on a <a href="/books">Books</a> section on this
website. I highlighted the ones that I especially liked and therefore recommend.
