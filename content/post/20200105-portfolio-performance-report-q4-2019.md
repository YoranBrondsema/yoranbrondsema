## Composition
The composition of my portfolio hasn't changed since [last quarter]({{< ref "post/20191010-portfolio-performance-report-q3-2019.md" >}}). Also, there's no need to rebalance yet.

## Growth
### Change in calculation
First of all, I did a small change in the calculation of the value of my portfolio. For the previous quarters, I took into account cash on my investment account for the calculation of the net asset value. Every month, I automatically send €200 to my investment account at Lynx and to reduce the impact of commission fees, I make purchases only every 3 months. So usually there is cash in my investment account, which I counted as part of the net asset value.

But I realized that this doesn't make much sense. So from now, the net asset value is going to represent solely the value of my portfolio of ETFs, without counting any cash that is sitting in the investment account. This means that the net asset values on the following graph are a little lower than on for instance the graph for [last quarter]({{< ref "post/20191010-portfolio-performance-report-q3-2019.md" >}}). I haven't changed the graphs of the previous reports but the following chart reflects the new calculation for all quarters up until now.

### The chart
{{< figure src="/images/2019-q4-portfolio-growth.svg" caption="Portfolio performance as of January 1st 2019." >}}

The last quarter of 2019 was very good. **I invested a total of €661** yet **the value of the portfolio increased by €1,985**. So far, my **total return has been 15.1%** since I started investing in February 2018.

## Performance per asset
{{< figure src="/images/2019-q4-performance-per-asset.svg" caption="Performance per asset in my portfolio as of January 1st 2020." >}}

The biggest winners of last quarter were emerging markets (XMME) and small-cap stocks (IUSN). The MSCI World index (IWDA) also grew a fair amount. Both real-estate (EPRA) and government bonds (DBZB) went down over the last quarter.

## 2019 in review
Because this was the last quarter of the year, let's do a recap of 2019. As the
following numbers and charts will show, it was an excellent year to be invested
in the markets.

### My savings
* **Total invested:** €3,010
* **Total growth of net asset value:** €9,404
* **My net asset value went from €26,306 to €35,710** (33.7% growth)

### Performance per asset
{{< figure src="/images/2019-performance-per-asset.svg" caption="Performance per asset in my portfolio in 2019" >}}

The chart above shows the relative change of each asset in my portfolio over the course of the year, relative to its value on January 1st 2019.

First of all, **all assets in my portfolio have grown in 2019**. Not a single fund resulted in a loss. Secondly, **the MSCI World index (IWDA) grew by almost 30%**! Other strong funds were XMME (MSCI Emerging Markets), IUSN (MSCI World Small Cap) and EPRA (FTSE EPRA/NAREIT). **Government bonds (DBZB) had the worst performance** with a growth of 4%.
