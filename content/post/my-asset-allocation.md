In a previous post, I explained some of the <a href="{{< ref "post/a-crash-course-on-asset-allocation.md" >}}">basic principles of asset allocation</a>.
Here, I am going to present the concrete selection of ETFs that I have started
building up since February of this year. First I am going to go over the
various allocation classes that are in my portfolio. After that, I will show
which ETFs I selected for each class. This latter part is especially interesting
for other Belgian investors.

## The portfolio in allocation classes
After reading a lot on the matter (not that I am done learning), I settled on
the portfolio below.

Type of investment | Allocation
-------------------|-----------
Government bonds   | 15%
MSCI World         | 50%
Small cap          | 15%
Emerging markets   | 10%
REIT               | 10%

### Government bonds
Bonds are a loan that you make to an institution such a government or a
corporation. As the lender, you make a return through the interest.

#### How much in bonds, how much in stocks?
Between stocks and bonds, bonds are the least risky. This means that it is less
volatile but it also yields less potential returns. One of the most important
splits in a portfolio is therefore how much you allocate in bonds and how much
you allocate in stocks. There are several guidelines on this.

For instance, Benjamin Graham (one of Warren Buffett's mentors) had the
following to say about it:

> We have suggested as a fundamental guiding rule that the investor should never
  have less than 25% or more than 75% of his funds in common stocks, with a
  consequence inverse range of 75% to 25% in bonds. There is an implication here
  that the standard division should be an equal one, or 50-50, between the two
  major investment mediums. 

John Bogle recommends to invest roughly your age in bonds. This means that if
you're 35 years old, he recommends a portfolio of 35% bonds and 65% stocks.

I find both of these guidelines to be quite conservative. In the end, it is all
about how much you risk you are willing to take and how long your time horizon
is. If you plan on retiring in 5 years, you simply can't afford to lose half
your money in the case a 2008 scenario repeats. Then, it is wise to invest the
majority of your portfolio in bonds.

In my case, being 28 years old, I estimate having about 40 years of saving ahead
of me. If there's a big economic downturn in a few years, I'll have plenty of
time to recover from those losses. For this reason, I chose for a 15%-85% split.
This is pretty risky according to these guidelines but this is a risk which I
can live with.

#### Government bonds over corporate bonds
Furthermore, I chose not to include corporate bonds and went for only
governments bonds instead. Since the bonds part of a portfolio is the safe part,
I'd rather not take risks through corporate bonds.

### MSCI World
The MSCI World is an index that consists of 1,654 stocks from companies from the
developed world. It is rougly a mix of the biggest companies from the
US, Europe, Japan and other developed nations ([this brochure](https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/178e6643-6ae6-47b9-82be-e1fc565ededb)
contains more information).

I like to see it as an investment in the world economy because it represents the
largest companies from the biggest economies in the world. That's why it takes
the biggest portion of my portoflio at 50%.

### Small cap
A small cap fund is a fund that invests in smaller companies but that are still
publicly traded. In <a href="{{< ref "post/a-crash-course-on-asset-allocation.md" >}}">"A crash course on asset allocation"</a>
I talked about how important it is to pick securities in your portfolio that are
not correlated or negatively correlated. This is exactly the utility of a small
cap fund in a portfolio. History shows that there are periods where the largest
companies suffer but smaller companies flourish, and vice versa. Hence a small
cap fund will not be completely correlated with a total market index such as
MSCI World.

A small cap index is definitely more volatile than the MSCI World index, which
warrants a lower allocation of 15%.

### Emerging markets
Emerging markets are countries such as China, South Korea, India and Brazil. A
portion invested in those markets makes sense for the same reason why small cap
stocks are included: diversification. After all, the economies in these
countries don't always follow the trend of the world economy.

### REIT
REIT, or real-estate investment trusts, are funds that invest in the real-estate
market. This market moves fairly distinctly from the bond or stock market.
Therefore, they're great for diversification.

## The corresponding ETFs
So now we know what allocation classes are in my portfolio. We still have to
pick specific ETFs for each class. This is where the country to live in matters
as some funds are only available to US investors and others are targeted for
European investors.

Let's recap the <a href="{{< ref "post/passive-investing-in-belgium.md" >}}">criteria for a Belgian investor</a>:

* always pick accumulating ETFs
* invest in funds domiciled in Ireland or Luxembourg

Finding the right ETFs that match these criteria and that also have a low total
expense ratio was quite a long process. It involved lots of comparisons on
[justETF](https://www.justetf.com/en). But in the end I managed to find a mix
that I'm satifisfied with:

Type               | ETF                                                                                                                              | TER
-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----
Government bonds   | [Lyxor EuroMTS Highest Rated Macro-Weighted Government Bond](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?isin=LU1287023342)      | 0.17%
MSCI World         | [iShares Core MSCI World](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00B4L5Y983)                                         | 0.20%
Small cap          | [BNP Paribas Easy MSCI Europe Small Caps ex Controversial Weapons](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?isin=LU1291101555)| 0.25%
Emerging markets   | [Xtrackers MSCI Emerging Markets](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00BTJRMP35)                                 | 0.20%
REIT               | [Amundi ETF FTSE EPRA Europe Real Estate](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?isin=LU1681039480)                         | 0.35%

All these ETFs can be bought through Lynx and probably the other brokers in
Europe too.

## My investment plan
On February, I invested part of my savings according to this allocation.
Currently, I am planning to rebalance and invest more of my savings at the end
of the year. The reason I don't do this more frequently is because there are
transaction costs involved with every trade. However, I might change my mind and
do an intermediate round towards the end of June.

For the longer term, I want to stick with this asset allocation for a long
period of time. At some point, I will want to increase the portion of bonds but
I feel that I have some years ahead before that moment comes.

## What about the results?
I will post the first quarterly report here in July. I'm looking forward to
sharing this with you as I'm extremely curious myself how my portfolio actually
performs in practice.

In any case, the whole process in getting to this portfolio has been very
informative and I thoroughly enjoyed all the reading I did, as well as figuring
things out. I embarked on a learning journey that I hope not to abort soon.
