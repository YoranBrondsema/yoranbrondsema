## Changes in the composition of my portfolio
Since <a href="{{< ref "post/portfolio-performance-report-july-2018.md" >}}">last quarter</a>, I made a few changes to my portfolio. I didn't change any weightings but replaced all of the EU-centric funds with more global funds. This way, I am reducing the exposure to financial problems that may arise in the EU.

- **Government bonds** I replaced <a href="https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?query=LU0908508731&groupField=index&from=search&isin=LU0908508731">MAA</a> with <a href="https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?query=LU0908508731&groupField=index&from=search&isin=LU0908508731">XG7S</a>. At 0.20% TER, XG7S is slightly more expensive. However, it tracks the FTSE World Government Bond Index, which consists of bonds of all developed countries, whereas MAA only has European bonds.
- **Small cap** I replaced <a href="https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?isin=LU1291101555">EESM</a> with <a href="https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?query=IE00BF4RFH31&groupField=index&from=search&isin=IE00BF4RFH31">IUSN</a>. EESM tracks MSCI Europe Small Caps whereas IUSN tracks MSCI World Small Caps.
- **REIT** I replaced <a href="https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?isin=LU1291101555">EPRE</a> with <a href="https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?isin=LU1437018838">EPRA</a>.

This is what my portfolio looks like today:

Type               | ETF                                                                                                 | Allocation | TER

## Growth of portfolio
![Portfolio performance as of October 1st 2018](/images/2018-q3-portfolio-growth.png)

In Q3 of 2018, I invested â‚¬1,629 into the portfolio. Also, the total value of my
portfolio grew as quite a few asset classes performed well. The 0.39% return
from Q2 grew to a **2.83%** return. So far, this is quite a lot better than the
interest rate you get from a savings account!

## Performance per asset
![Performance per asset as of October 1st 2018](/images/2018-q3-performance-per-asset.png)

The graph above shows the performance of various assets in my portfolio since
February 1st 2018. Note that some data starts later. Those are because of the
changes mentioned above. For this reason, there is not so much to say except
that stocks seem to be going downwards but bonds are staying stable. This is
exactly why we have bonds in our portfolio!
