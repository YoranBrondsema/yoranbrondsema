Here is a selection of software that I have written.

### <a href="https://www.sutori.com">Sutori</a>
Being the CTO of Sutori is my day-job and it's the app I spend by far the most
time working on. It's also the biggest piece of software that I've built. It's
currently used by hundreds of thousands of teachers and students across the
world, which is something we're all proud of!

### <a href="https://www.whatifilosemy2fa.com">What If I Lose My 2FA</a>
This project was born out of frustration with losing access to my 2FA-secured
accounts after I had to reinstall my phone. It gives the exact information that
you need to keep somewhere safe in case you lose your 2FA device. This way you
don't have to waste time visiting your bank and having a notary sign papers,
like I did.
