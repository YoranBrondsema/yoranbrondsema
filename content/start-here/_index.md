Although I didn't intent it from the start, my writing on this blog has focused
more and more on investing. I started caring about my financial well-being and
investing in 2017, and have been documenting my investment journey:

* The finance sector is vast, confusing and requires quite a lot of knowledge
  just to get started. The products and solutions offered by the various
  companies in the industry are not as user-friendly as they should be (at least
  not in Europe). Through my writing, **I want to help people to get started
  investing by explaining things in simple terms.**
* There are many books, blogs, forums and other resources available to learn
  about investing. However, most of them are focused on the US. When I got
  started, I found that there was a gap in the information available for
  European investors. This blog therefore **is written specifically for European
  investors**.

## Curvo: the easiest way to passively invest
Our generation is facing an uncertain financial future. Our state-funded
pension systems are under increasing pressure due to changing demographics and
we need to be better prepared financially. But savings accounts are not
sufficient. Inflation has been above interest rates since 2008. This means that
every year, our savings lose some of their value. 

At the same time, investing is hard. You have to define your portfolio, find a
broker, figure how taxes work… We've been through this ourselves and realised
that acquiring this knowledge and skillset take a lot of time, perseverance and
a certain confidence in your own capacity for making good decisions. The
finance world is intimidating, filled with jargon and full of people who want
to separate you from your money.

So me and my co-founder Thomas Ketchell built Curvo: the easiest way for
Belgians to passively invest. We take care of all the complexities of
investing.

## Backtest: the backtesting tool for the European index investor
I developed [Backtest](https://curvo.eu/backtest), the backtesting tool for the
European index investor. Use it to gain insight into your portfolio through its performance in the past. As an example, [analyze the past performance of my portfolio](https://curvo.eu/backtest/portfolio/curvo-growth--NoIgwgrgTgbg9gAgOJTgdwC4AsQBpigCSAogAykBCArACxUBsA7DTXqQHQAcAuviCeQoBpAGqkA6gCYaAZjbtJ3JUA).

## Performance reports between 2018 and 2021
Between 2018 and 2021, I posted the performance reports of [my portfolio](/investment-portfolio) on a quarterly basis. The regularity gave me
the discipline to keep track and get insights.
