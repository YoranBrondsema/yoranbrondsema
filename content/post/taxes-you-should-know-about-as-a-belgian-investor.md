No one likes them but everyone has to pay them: taxes. As investors, we also
have to make our contributions that are necessary to live in a fair and equal
society.

There are four types of taxes that are relevant to a Belgian investor who mainly
invests in index funds and ETFs:

1. tax on transactions
2. tax on dividends
3. tax on capital gains for bonds
4. tax on trading accounts

What follows is an overview of those taxes. I provide some links <a href="{{< relref "#want-to-know-more" >}}">at the end</a>
if you want dig a bit deeper.

## Word of caution
The information presented here is up-to-date at the time of writing (December
20th 2018). However, every new government likes to make some changes to the tax
system so it might be outdated by the time you're reading this.

## Tax on transactions ("beurstaks" or "taxe boursière")
There's a tax on the transaction every time you buy or sell a security. If the
ETF you are purchasing or selling is registered on a particular list maintained
by the European Economic Area, then the tax equals 0.12% of the transaction
amount. Otherwise, it's 0.35%. Fortunately, most ETFs available in Europe are on
this list. All the funds in <a href="{{< ref "post/portfolio-performance-report-q3-2018.md" >}}">my portfolio</a>
are.

There is not really a strategy to reduce this tax. Since it's a percentage,
buying more or less securities in one transaction isn't going to affect the
total amount of tax that you will end up paying.

## Tax on dividends ("roerende voorheffing" or "pŕecompte mobilier")
There's a 30% tax on dividends that you perceive through shares that you hold.
This tax is applicable to individual stocks but also to distributing funds.

This tax is the main reason why accumulating funds are preferred over
distributing funds. Indeed, with accumulating funds, the dividends are directly
reinvested into the fund, thereby bypassing this tax. Furthermore, an added
benefit is that you don't have to spend time on deciding how to reinvest the
dividends. After all, when you are a passive investor, you want to spend the
least amount of time possible managing your investments!

In <a href="{{< ref "post/portfolio-performance-report-q3-2018.md" >}}">my portfolio</a>,
you will only see accumulating funds. I also wrote about what be careful about when selecting a fund in my post about
<a href="{{< ref "post/passive-investing-in-belgium.md" >}}">passive investing in Belgium</a>.

## Tax on capital gains for bonds
For funds that consist of at least 10% bonds, there is a 30% tax on the profits
made when selling it. For example, if you bought a bond at €100 and end up
selling it later for €130, your net profit will only be €21. The other €9 will
go to the Belgian state through this tax.

Regarding this tax, the best strategy is to limit the number of funds in your
portfolio that contain bonds. In my portfolio,
[XG7S](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?isin=%20LU0908508731) is the
only fund that has bonds. Actually, it consists of only bonds as it tracks the
FTSE World Government Bond Index. This is better than having multiple funds that
consist of a mix of bonds and stocks as you'll end up paying this tax on all
those funds.

Another consideration is that this tax gives more incentive to invest in stocks
rather than bonds. This is contradicting with the common strategy of investing
more in bonds as you get older, because of their reduced volatility. Something
to ponder about!

## Tax on trading accounts ("taks op effectenrekeningen" or "taxes sur les comptes-titres")
Belgium will withhold a yearly 0.15% tax on any trading account (for instance on
Lynx, Binck Bank or Degiro) whose value exceeds €500,000. With such a high
limit, it's a good problem to have!
