Here is a selection of the projects that I am working on or have worked on in
the past.

## <a href="https://www.sutori.com">Sutori</a>
Being the CTO of Sutori is my day-job and it's the app I spend by far the most
time working on. It's also the biggest piece of software that I've built. It's
currently used by over a million teachers and students across the
world, which is something we're all proud of!

## <a href="https://enzo.fund/?utm_source=yoranbrondsema-blog">Enzo</a>
Our latest project that I introduced [in a post](https://www.yoranbrondsema.com/post/introducing-enzo-a-better-way-of-saving-money/). Investing is hard yet I believe it's crucial for our generation to be well-prepared for the future. Enzo aims to make passive investing easy and accessible to everyone.

## <a href="https://www.whatifilosemy2fa.com">What If I Lose My 2FA</a>
This project was born out of frustration with losing access to my 2FA-secured
accounts after I had to reinstall my phone. It gives the exact information that
you need to keep somewhere safe in case you lose your 2FA device. This way you
don't have to waste time visiting your bank and having a notary sign papers,
like I did.
