## Growth of portfolio
{{< figure src="/images/2018-q4-portfolio-growth.svg" caption="Portfolio performance as of January 1st 2019." >}}

In Q4 of 2018, I invested an additional â‚¬916 into the portfolio. Unfortunately,
the portfolio suffered just like the whole market did. This resulted in a 6.5%
loss for the total value of the portfolio. However, fluctuations are expected so
I'm not worried about the long-term return.

## Performance per asset
![Performance per asset as of January 1st 2019](/images/2018-q4-performance-per-asset.svg)

Both the stocks and the real-estate funds suffered a lot. The performance of the
bonds was the only bright spot: XG7S grew by 3.2% over the last 3 months.
