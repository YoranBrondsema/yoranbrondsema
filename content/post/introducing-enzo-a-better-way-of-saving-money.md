Together with [Thomas](https://twitter.com/tomketch), my co-founder from
[Sutori](https://www.sutori.com), we started a new side-project called Enzo.
With Enzo, we want to drastically improve the financial well-being of our
generation by passively investing your savings instead of keeping it all in a
savings account. It grew from the realization that investing is difficult,
time-consuming, yet is crucial for our generation to be prepared for the future.

## My journey into passive investing
If you've read some of my writings, you will have noticed that I mostly write
about personal finance and investing. This is an interest of mine that grew out
of the frustration of the low returns for my savings account and a will to be
better prepared for my future. Since then, I've become convinced that passive
investing is the best form of investing for most people.

## Investing is hard
As I dug into the world of investing, I realized how difficult it is to get
started. You have to [define your portfolio](https://www.yoranbrondsema.com/post/a-crash-course-on-asset-allocation/), [find a broker](https://www.yoranbrondsema.com/post/passive-investing-in-belgium/#how-do-i-buy-etfs), [know about taxes](https://www.yoranbrondsema.com/post/taxes-you-should-know-about-as-a-belgian-investor/),... Acquiring this knowledge and skills takes a lot of time, perseverance and a certain confidence in your own capacity for taking good decisions. The finance world is intimidating, filled with jargon and full of people who want to separate you from your money. Having gone through the whole process, I'm not surprised that hardly any of the people
around me invest their money.

This problem is especially important in Europe, where services like Wealthfront
or Betterment aren't available.

The image above is a screenshot taken from the website of an actual bank. The
average person who has no financial knowledge and who comes onto this page, is
presented with too many options and technical terms. It's understandable if he
then clicks away and thinks _"Nevermind, I'll just leave my money in my savings
account."_.

## Our generation is facing a scary financial future
At the same time, I became aware that our generation, the "millennials", is
facing a scary financial future and needs to be better prepared financially. Our
state-funded pension systems are under increasing pressure due to changing
demographics. For instance, 40% of the Belgian population will be over
the age of 67 by 2060 whereas today, only 25% of the population is in that age
group. I think that our pension systems will need to adapt in such a way that
individual contributions will become more and more important.

## So we started Enzo
For these reasons, me and Thomas started
[Enzo](https://enzo.fund/?utm_source=yoranbrondsema-blog&utm_medium=blog-post&utm_campaign=introducing-enzo): our goal is
to **improve the financial well-being of our generation** by giving easy access
to passive investing. No need to read dozens of books on how to define your
asset allocation like we did. No need to study the [Bogleheads wiki](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Investing_from_Belgium) to learn about
taxes in your country. There's even no need to know what an index fund is. With
Enzo, you will be able to boost your savings while requiring no financial
knowledge.  And by pushing automation, it won't require any of your time either.

At the same time, we see a big need for educating our peers on how to live a
financially healthy life. The number of people who have little savings and are
living paycheck to paycheck is scarily high. This is a very dangerous situation
to be in as it exposes you to big risks, for instance in case of illness,
disability, losing of a job... Our second mission therefore is **to arm our
customers with the right knowledge to improve their financial lives**.

We are using the experience that we acquired in building
[Sutori](https://www.sutori.com), an educational platform that we scaled to over
1 million teachers and students across the globe using it. We have learned a lot
over the past few years on how to grow a product and build a brand that is used
and loved by this many users. We are now applying these skills, knowledge and
experience to Enzo.

## Built for Europeans
We are building Enzo specifically for Europeans. We started a [waiting list](https://enzo.fund/?utm_source=yoranbrondsema-blog&utm_medium=blog-post&utm_campaign=introducing-enzo#sign-up) because we are still in the process of acquiring a
license. This is required to be operate a company in the finance industry. We
are expecting to launch the product during the next few months.

**If Enzo piques your interest, don't hesitate to head over to
