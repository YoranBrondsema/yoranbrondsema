In the <a href="{{< ref "post/an-intro-to-passive-investing.md"
>}}">first part</a>, I gave an introduction to passive investing. In this post,
I will describe my experiences starting investing in Belgium.

## How do I buy ETFs?
You need to go through a broker to buy ETFs. The major banks (Belfius, BNP
Paribas Fortis, etc...) can act as a broker but that is not recommended:

* Every time you buy a fund, there is a transaction cost involved. This is the
  commission for the broker. The big banks charge transaction costs that are a
  lot higher than specialized brokers do.
* Their trading platform is not as good as the specialized brokers'.

Instead, there are a couple of specialized brokers to choose from. I ended up
going with [Lynx](https://www.lynx.be/) as I had read good reviews about them.
However, I don't know enough about the others to give a judgment.

Getting started with Lynx was straightforward and is all done online. You fill
in a form and send it along with a piece of identification. Once this has gone
through, you have to make a one-time â‚¬2,000 deposit on your new Lynx account to
activate it. Then you're ready to start investing!

## How do I know what to buy?
### Asset allocation
Defining the right portfolio is probably the most important and most difficult
task for every investor. The topic is very big and I don't feel qualified enough
to give advice here. Furthermore, the composition of your portfolio is dependent
on your appetite for risk, your age and your income. Instead, I point you to
the <a href="{{< relref "#resources" >}}">Resources</a> section below to learn
more about asset allocation.

### justETF
While doing my research on what ETFs to buy, I found the site
[justETF](https://www.justetf.com/en/) very useful. It allows you to compare
various ETFs in terms of TER (Total Expense Ratio), fund size, return and a few
other parameters. Some indexes, such as MSCI World, are offered by [multiple asset managers](https://www.justetf.com/en/how-to/msci-world-etfs.html) so it
pays off to do a comparison and pick the one with the lowest TER.

Once you found an ETF that you want to buy, just copy its International
Securities Identification Number (ISIN) and paste it into the Lynx Trader view.

## Belgium-specific tax matters
### Always pick accumulating ETFs
Almost every company pays dividends to its shareholders. When you buy an ETF,
you have in fact become a shareholder in the companies in the ETF's portfolio.
Therefore, you will get dividends. What happens with these dividend earnings?
The distribution policy of a fund can be either _accumulating_ or
_distributing_.

For _accumulating_ funds, the dividend earnings are automatically re-invested
into the ETF.

In contrast, for _distributing_ funds, the dividends are paid out to you in
cash. That money becomes yours so you can do with it what you want.

I strongly recommend picking accumulating funds:

* The most important reason is that the Belgian government takes 25% of your
  earnings as tax. However, this does not happen if the dividend earnings are
  directly re-invested into the fund. So the Belgian taxman takes 0% on dividend
  earnings for accumulating funds.
* It requires less work. When investing in distributing funds, you have to
  regularly decide on what to do with your dividend earnings. This gives you a
  chance to re-adjust your portfolio but this also gives you a chance to mess
  things up.

### Invest in funds domiciled in Ireland or Luxembourg
If you are not a resident from the country, Ireland and Luxembourg do not make
you pay any tax withholding. Therefore, to reduce tax costs, pick funds that are
domiciled in Ireland or Luxembourg. Most of the ones that you find on
[justETF](https://www.justetf.com/en) are but just make sure before you make a
purchase.

## Resources
Investing is such a wide topic and I'm myself just starting my journey. Here are
some resources that I found useful and that can help you get started.

### Books
When diving into a new topic, I find that I always learn best from good ol'
books. Fortunately, there's a wealth of books on investing. I maintain a [list of the books about investing that I read](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/120281.Books_about_investing)
on Goodreads.

#### _Money: Master the Game - 7 Simple Steps to Financial Freedom_ by Tony Robbins
This was the first book I read on investing. Tony Robbins is a self-help guru
and this book is not an exception to the characteristic that all self-help books
seem to share: it is very repetitive. It counts 688 pages but you'll go through
them rather quickly.

However, the content in itself is good. It covers the basics of personal money
management and I found it to be a good introduction into the investor mentality.
Furthermore, it describes the major types of asset classes (bonds, stocks,
annuities, etc...) so you end up getting a basic grasp of these.

#### _The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing_ by Taylor Larimore
Bogleheads are the followers of the principles laid out by Jack Bogle. He's the
founder of the Vanguard Group and that makes him the father of index funds and
therefore passive investing. In this book, they lay out his philosophy of
investing in low-cost index funds rather than trying to beat the market. This is
also the approach that I try to follow in my own investments.

The content is very similar to _Money_ by Tony Robbins. However, it goes
slightly more in depth while using less words (it has less than half the pages).
I consider it a foundational book and I recommend skipping _Money_ and reading
this instead. Its only downside is that it is targeted to US residents. This
means that some of the chapters, namely the ones about taxation, are not
relevant.

#### _A Random Walk Down Wall Street_ by Burton G. Malkiel
This book is quite dense but I found it very interesting. It exposes the
theoretical foundations of why passive investing works so well and why the other
approach, i.e. trying to time the market, cannot work consistently over longer
periods of time. I found the chapter covering the history of the financial
markets very interesting too.

I recommend reading this book after _the Bogleheads' Guide to Investing_.

#### _The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life_ by Alice Schroeder
Warren Buffett is probably the most famous and most successful investor ever. If
you pick up this biography of his life, be ready to spend some time on it as
it's 929 pages long (and unlike Tony Robbins' book, it doesn't repeat itself).
I found it very rewarding. It won't teach you concrete tips and tricks on how to
invest but it sheds a light on the philosophy of one of the best businessmen of
the 20th century.

### Online
Here are some links that helped me get started.

- <https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Investing_from_Belgium> The Bogleheads Wiki
  contains a wealth of information about the "Bogle" philosophy of investing but
  this page in particular deals with the specifics for Belgium.
- <https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/EU_investing> Similar but for the entire
  European Union.
- <https://www.justetf.com> A good resource to find and compare ETFs.
- <https://www.reddit.com/r/investing> Quite active subreddit about investing
  in general. It has a lot of good resource in the sidebar too.
- <https://www.reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance> Not as active but targeted to EU
  residents.


## Why did I write this?
I am not claiming to be an expert in investing. In fact, I am just starting to
learn about the topic. But while figuring things out, I couldn't find
introductory texts on how to get started if you live in Belgium. There's a lot
of information out there but it's very scattered. So I hope that by writing
about my experiences, I can help some people.
